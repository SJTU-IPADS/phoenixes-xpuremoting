# PhoenixOS-Remoting

<b>PhoenixOS-Remoting</b> (PhOS-remote) is an fully-optimized API remoting framework for GPU API calls from various vendors, which is a key technique to implement GPU virtualization / pooling.

> [!NOTE]  
> The current release version of PhOS (v0.10) relies on <a href="https://github.com/RWTH-ACS/cricket">RWTH-ACS/cricket</a> for remoting GPU API calls, we thank cricket's authors.<br />
> We have fully developped our own Rust-based framework for optimizing API remoting, which would be released soon.<br />
